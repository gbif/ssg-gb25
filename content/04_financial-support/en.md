# Financial support

The GBIF Secretariat offers the possibility of applying for partial funding to attend 1) the Governing Board meeting, and/or 2) the Global Nodes meeting. Support may include partial funding of economy-class flight tickets and accommodation. 

Limited funding has already been allocated for such support, and the Secretariat is working to secure additional funding. 

The application process is now open.  

Please see below for more details on the guidelines for seeking partial funding for the two events. Link to the application form can be found at the bottom of this page. 

**Deadline for applying is Monday 31 July. Applications should be sent to [GB24@gbif.org](mailto:GB24@gbif.org)**
**Applications received after the deadline will not be considered**

The GBIF Secretariat staff will inform applicants about the outcome of their application in the beginning of August.  

## Global Nodes meeting, 24-25 September 2017

- All GBIF Node managers are eligible to apply for partial funding. 
-	As the funds available are limited, the requests for support will be prioritized as follows: 
  +	Node managers/representatives from Voting Participant countries which are in good standing in regard to GBIF financial contributions.
  +	Node managers/representatives from other Voting and Associate Participant countries, based on level of activity and contribution to GBIF.
  +	Node manager/representatives from Associate Participant organizations, based on level of activity and contribution to GBIF.
-	Support is primarily intended for Node manager. However, a Participant may alternatively request support for a different nodes staff member to attend the meeting in place of the Node manager. In such cases, a written confirmation of this reassignment by the Node manager must accompany the application form.  
-	Only one representative per node is eligible to receive support.
-	The application form (download link at the bottom of this page) must be submitted within the deadline, including the following information: 
  +	A draft economy class flight schedule from country of origin to Finland and indication of the flight costs
  +	The number of days requested for accommodation support
  +	A confirmation that the delegate will be able to cover all other costs (visa, health insurance, per diem, etc.) 
-	Funding will not be provided in advance of the meeting, but by reimbursement after the meeting. 

## Governing Board meeting, 26-27 September 2017

-	Partial financial support for the Governing Board meeting is only available for GBIF Voting Participants representing developing countries (1) and in good standing in regard to GBIF financial contributions. 
-	Support is primarily intended for Heads of Delegation. However, a Participant may alternatively request support for a different delegate to attend in place of the Head of Delegation.  In such cases, a written confirmation of this reassignment by the Head of Delegation must accompany the application form.  
-	Only one delegate per delegation is eligible to receive support.
-	An application form (download link at the bottom of this page) must be submitted within the deadline, including the following information: 
  +	A draft economy class flight schedule from country of origin to Finland and indication of the flight costs

1) For this purpose, developing countries are defined as countries whose per capita GDP was less than USD 13,500 according to 2013 World Bank figures, the benchmark used to apply discounted contributions in the current GBIF funding period. See list of developing countries [here](https://gb24.gbif.org/raw/GBIF_VP_developing_countries.pdf). 


## Attending both events?

If you will attend both the Global Nodes meeting and the Governing Board meeting, you may apply for funding covering both events. However, please read the guidelines for both events carefully.
