# Financial support

The GBIF Secretariat offers the possibility of applying for partial funding to attend the Governing Board meeting on 16-17 October 2018. Support may include partial funding of economy-class flight tickets and accommodation. 

The application process is now open. Please see below for more details on the guidelines for seeking partial funding for the event. 

Link to the application form can be found at the bottom of this page. 

Deadline for applying is **Friday 10 August 2018**. Applications should be sent to [GB25@gbif.org](mailto:GB25@gbif.org)
Applications received after the deadline will not be considered

-	Partial financial support for the Governing Board meeting is only available for GBIF Voting Participants representing developing countries and in good standing in regard to GBIF financial contributions. 


*(For this purpose, developing countries are defined as countries whose per capita GDP was less than USD 13,500 according to the 2013 World Bank figures, the benchmark used to apply discounted contributions in the current GBIF funding period. See list of developing countries [here](https://gb25.gbif.org/raw/GBIF_VP_developing_countries.pdf)).*

-	Support is primarily intended for Heads of Delegation. However, a Participant may alternatively request support for a different delegate to attend in place of the Head of Delegation.  In such cases, a written confirmation of this reassignment by the Head of Delegation must accompany the application form.  
		Only one delegate per delegation is eligible to receive support.
		An application form (download link at the bottom of this page) must be submitted within the deadline, including the following information: 
  +	A draft economy class flight schedule from country of origin to Ireland and indication of the flight costs
  		The number of days requested for accommodation support
  		A confirmation that the delegate will be able to cover all other costs (visa, health insurance, per diem, etc.) 
- Funding will not be provided in advance of the meeting, but by reimbursement after the meeting. 


Do not hesitate contacting the Secretariat at [GB25@gbif.org](mailto:GB25@gbif.org) if you have any questions. 

The GBIF Secretariat staff will inform applicants about the outcome of their application in the beginning of September.
