The National Biodiversity Data Centre, on behalf of Ireland, is pleased to host the **25th meeting (GB25) of the GBIF Governing Board** and warmly welcomes all delegations to Kilkenny. 

The official Governing Board meeting will take place on 16-17 October 2018. 

GBIF Governance committee meetings will take place on 15 October. 

The National Biodiversity Data Centre also kindly invites participants to a public symposium **"Biodiversity loss in a changing world: local data, global action"**, on 18 October. 

A post-meeting excursion, for which a small charge will apply, will be offered to delegates on Friday 19 October to visit some peatland sites in the Irish Midlands. There will also be an option for those who do not wish to attend, to instead participate in a local heritage tour of Kilkenny City.
