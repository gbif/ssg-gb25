## Travel requirements for entering Ireland

GB25 participants are responsible for preparing their own travel documentation requirements for entering Ireland.

### Visa

The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) is the organisation responsible for visa services in Ireland. Visit their website [www.inis.gov.ie](http://www.inis.gov.ie) if you wish to check whether you require a visa or not to travel to Ireland. If so, the minimum requirements will need to be met. That includes: 

1. An application letter
   - This outlines why you want to travel, how the conference relates to your employment, and on what dates you will travel
2. A letter from GBIF 
   - This describes what the conference is, confirms that you are registered to attend, and outlines who is paying for the cost of the trip
   - Please contact us by email should you require this letter: [GB25@gbif.org](mailto:GB25@gbif.org)
3. A letter from your employer
   - This should state that you are travelling on their behalf, how long you will be away and what date you will return to work
4. Proof of your hotel booking for the dates of the trip
5. Your current passport and copies of any expired passports
6. 6 month’s bank statements, issued within 2 weeks of the visa application
7. If you have ever been refused a visa, or if you have been refused entry to any country, you must include a copy of the refusal letter with your application and declare it on your application form. Failure to declare this is an automatic reason for refusal.

It is paramount that all applicants submit their visa applications at least 8 weeks before the date you are due to travel to Ireland. 

**Note:** A Schengen visa or UK visa is not valid for travel to Ireland. See more information on visa requirements and travel documents from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade: [https://www.dfa.ie/travel/visas/visas-for-ireland/](https://www.dfa.ie/travel/visas/visas-for-ireland/).

### Personal security

Kilkenny is generally a very safe town. Pickpockets may be a risk but the rate of theft is more than likely lower than typical major cities. 

In Ireland, we have two emergency numbers, 999 and 112. 112 or 999 should only be called when there is a risk to life or property, where there is a crime being committed or the prospect of a crime being committed and when a person feels their personal safety is being threatened.

For information on how to use these numbers and what to expect when you do please go to: [www.112.ie](http://www.112.ie). 

[An Garda Síochána](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/law_enforcement/garda_siochana_national_police_force.html) is the national police force. It has responsibility for carrying out all policing duties in the state. 

The [Health Service Executive (HSE)](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health_system/emergency_health_services_in_ireland.html) has responsibility for the delivery of public emergency health services. 



### Telecommunication and internet (mobile phone networks, internet services)

The main network providers are Three, Vodafone and eir. 

For more information please visit: http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/Ireland. 

The Kilkenny Ormonde Hotel provides WiFi for users, as does most other accommodations. 



### Opening hours

Shops and department stores are generally open between 08:30hrs and 18:00hrs, Monday to Saturday. Many shops are closed on Sunday. Banks are generally open between 09:00hrs and 16:00hrs, Monday to Friday. 



### Tips and service gratuities

Tips are not expected and with regards to restaurants the service generally included. Feel free to tip if you feel you have received excellent service.



### Weather

Ireland’s location on the western edge of the European continent in the path of moist Atlantic air and the moderating effect of the Gulf Stream ensure that the island is rarely very hot or very cold. The average October temperature in Kilkenny is a mild 10 degree Celsius.

It must be noted that Ireland’s weather is quite changeable, so delegates should not be surprised if it rains. However long bouts of rain are quite rare.

It is advisable to check the weather forecasts close to departure: https://www.met.ie
